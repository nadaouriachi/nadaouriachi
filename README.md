# 👋 Hi! I'm Nada Ouriachi

🎓 I'm a first-year Software Engineering student passionate about learning new technologies and applying them to solve diverse problems or create exciting experiences

🌱 Currently diving into:
- Object Oriented Programming (Java, Python and C#)
- Web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Data structures and algorithms

💡 Throughout this year, I aim to share various personal projects, notably featuring APIs and databases, as I continue to learn about them independently
